# Exploring Wavelet Trees as Space-Efficient Physical-to-Sorted Mapping for Learned Indexes

## Overview

This project implements and evaluates **Integer Wavelet Trees (IWTs)** and higher-fanout **T-way IWTs** as **space-efficient mappings** between the sorted and physical order of data in **learned indexes**.

- Evaluate trade-off between compression and access latency.
- Integrate IWTs with learned indexes like **RadixSpline**.
- Compare against classical indexes like **B+-trees** and **QuIT**.

## Build Instructions

cd wavelet-tree-mapping

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

make <binary_name>
```

## Generate Workloads

Our tests use `.bin` format for workloads - it can be easily tweaked to accept csv as well.  
We use the [BoDS framework](https://github.com/BU-DiSC/bods)

1. To replicate, use steps from [BoDS](https://github.com/BU-DiSC/bods) to generate bin files with varying degrees of sortedness.
2. Place the `.bin` files in a `workloads/` folder at the project root.

Example:
```
workloads/
 ├── n16777216_k0l0.bin      # Fully sorted
 ├── n16777216_k25l25.bin    # Partially sorted
 ├── ...
```

Example binaries:
- `permute_flat_multiary` — different variants of multiary trees can be selected later
- `li_wavelet_test` — learned index with wavelet
- `li_lsi_test` — learned index with LSI
